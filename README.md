# Airbnb-Data-Analysis
#### I Created this Internship Portfolio Data Analysis Project Using "Python" to perform "Exploratery Data anslysis (EDA)" and Creating "Dashboard report" Using "Power BI".

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on travelling possibilities and present more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. This dataset describes the listing activity and metrics in Amsterdam, Netherland for 2019.

The objective of the project is to perform data visualization techniques to understand the insight of the data. This project aims to apply Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Intelligence tools such as Power BI to get a visual understanding of the data.
